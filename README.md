# Elo7 Front-end Test

This is my project for the Front-end challenge from Elo7 company. I've used Svelte JS in all project and others technologies.

## Techs: 

- HTML and CSS ( semantic )
- Svelte JS 
- Javascript ( ES6 )
- Fetch Lib
- Packages:
  - svelte-seo
  - animate css
  
 ## Idea:
 
 - Create a main screen containing a summary about Elo7, what it's like to work here, some testimonials and our culture, as well as a list of open positions.
  
## Features:

- Use all assets and images provide from Elo7 team.
- Use Fetch Lib to request data from api provide with informations about open positions at the company.
- The design uses the power of Svelte to componentization and passing data and functions through components..
- Create some logic about available jobs positions following these steps :
  - Do not show inactive positions.
  - For data without location, replace with the word "Remote".
  
## Installation
